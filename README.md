<h2>About</h2>

Lapce is written in pure Rust, with UI in [Druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid). It's using [Xi-Editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor)'s [Rope Science](https://xi-editor.io/docs/rope_science_00.html) for text editing, and using [Wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for rendering. 

<h2>Features</h2>

* Modal Editing (Vim like) support as first class citizen (can be turned off as well)
* Built-in LSP support
* Built-in remote development support (inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview))
* Plugin can be written in programming languages that can compile to [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
* Built-in terminal
